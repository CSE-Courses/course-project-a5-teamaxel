1.  What is happening
        -   On submitting password, we are taken back to "child mode" screen
    What is supposed to happen
        -   it should take us to "admin mode" screen where we see only admin options
    Ideas/possible reasons why this is happening
    -   probably happening because html form action = "popup.html" which takes us
        to default settings

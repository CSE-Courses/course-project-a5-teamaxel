Current State:
First Time Admin
-   able to sync and modify storage data within submit listener for first time admin,
    however when calling "document.getElementById("creatingPass").value", it does not
    grab text and store into variable "desired_pass".
    -   if you uncomment lines 151, 154,156, & 157 you'll see the initialized password
        value changes to the string "starter", however if you uncomment line 152
        and comment 151, you'll see through testing on returning admin that 
        the grabbed value is nonexistent in storage (returns empty strings)
        -   to perform this test, uncommment lines 175,178,184.
    -   grabbing the password value within the returning admin works with the
        function "document.getElementById("unique").value"

tldr;
-   able to modify password info in desired logic flow, but currently only a hardcoded password
-   so far able to grab pass from storage with correctly stored value




Major bugs      //affect functionality on large scale


Minor bugs      //small front end issues that don't affect interaction

1.  What is happening   
        -   if you click the admin mode button within admin mode, you're asked to create password
        -   this is probably because that is the default for clicking on admin mode
            how to make admin mode not clickable when in admin mode. occurred once event.preventDefault added

2.  What is happening
        -   if you're within the password phase, click outside of the text area box, and
            hit enter, the submit button doesn't register the enter hit

3.  What is happening
        -   create a password, go to child mode, enter password, go to child mode, click admin mode, 
            automatically told that password is incorrect



 Potential User stories
 When in admin mode, want to stay in admin mode when exiting GUI (potential user story)
    -   either make the extension run in the background OR make two cases of admin and child mode stories
        child mode isnt default
